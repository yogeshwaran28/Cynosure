# Cynosure
Cynosure" is a website I created for our college symposium's registration. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to provide an easy-to-use platform. Participants fill out a Google Form for registration. The website is responsive, stylish, and secure. It offers event information and support options, enhancing the symposium experience.
